NOTE: 
- Need at least 2 filters, 1 being quantization from 8.5
- Use atleast 2 diff data structures

TODO:
- Write-up for O(n) for data structures
- Video, screenshare
    - Logic flow diagram
    - Demo

1. Quantization filter
- I'm gonna be using an Octree datatype which is like a binary tree but with 8 children on each node
- Show comparisons 

2. Blur
- Gaussian blur using matrix operations/convolution networks

3. Edge Detection
- Talk about police catching perpetrators by using CCTV footage and analysing the tattoos to detect the distinct gang related tattoos and solving a case of a hit and run.
